1. Defination
    Web Sessions
        period of time.(until the user logout or Session is time out)

    User <-Interation-> application
        client-side -cookies
        server-side -database
    
    maintain user prefrences 
        Usser login status
        items in online shopping Cart
        website layout/appearance prefrences


2. Working
    1. client - server  Architecture 

    User <=> APP <= (HTTP request>,<Response) => server

    2. HTTP is stateless 
    3. login credentials stored in server
    4. ID ->genrated 
        key : value pair
        "123":{login credentials} ->"session store"

    5. for every Interation request is generated  -> Session ID

    6. client-side session (data also share)   -default-> Falsk
       server-side session  (only id is share) -external library  

3. Types of Sessions  
    Based on duration
        1. Persistent session (permanant)
            ex. OTT platforms

        2. Non Persistent session(temporary)
            ex. browser/app

    Based on  Security
        1. Authenticated
            via login credentials
        2. Anonymous
            ex. amazon browse without login

    Based on storage location
        1. Client side
        2. server sise


4. Security Considerations
    1. Session ID
    2. Secure Cookies
    3. Session Timeout
    4. Logging & Monitoring

    5. Additional Measures:
       1. implement MFA(multi factor Authentication)
       2. prompt user to confirm and any all critical within a session
       3. Notify users before session Timeout due to inactivity, if they want to extend a session.
